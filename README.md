```
TOR was made for many people that don't want to be tracked and have everything do kept in private but it is used by many people in the wrong ways. For example, there are many pedophiles using this so that they cant be found out and they can share things with other pedophiles. There are also criminals which want to use this, such as they may want to hack into bank acounts and people won't know who did it.
