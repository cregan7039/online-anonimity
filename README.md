online-anonimity
================

Many people take their online privacy very seriously, concerned about who may be spying on them and reading their data. Some internet users turn to the TOR network.

Research and briefly describe what the TOR network is and how it works. (2 marks)

```
The TOR network is a software that stops people from analysing your data. It pretty much keeps your tracks covered and stop people from seeing what your doing and finding out who you are. Overall it keeps everything confidential. The way TOR works that it passes your data around many servers making it difficult for people to find out what you're doing

Discuss the risks and benefits of such a network. (6 marks)

```
TOR was made for many people that don't want to be tracked and have everything do kept in private but it is used by many people in the wrong ways. For example, there are many pedophiles using this so that they cant be found out and they can share things with other pedophiles. There are also criminals which want to use this, such as they may want to hack into bank acounts and people won't know who did it. There was a website called silkroad which people could interact with annonymously using software such as TOR and on the website you could buy pretty much anything from guns to slaves. So many people can get away by buying things which are illegal. In communist states such as China, they are not allowed to use the internet to access the outside world and find out what has happened in their country. This is because the state controls everything from internet to media so they can control everything.
